# Music-Genre-and-Composer-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning

Goal: 

The primary objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can predict the composer of a given musical score accurately. The project aims to accomplish this objective by using deep learning techniques: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).

Music is a form of art that is ubiquitous and has a rich history. Different composers have created music with their unique styles and compositions. However, identifying the composer of a particular piece of music can be a challenging task, especially for novice musicians or listeners. The proposed project aims to use deep learning techniques to identify the composer of a given piece of music accurately.

Dataset:

The project will use a dataset consisting of musical scores from various composers. Download the dataset from Kaggle websiteLinks to an external site..
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blanderbuss/midi-classic-music
The dataset contains the midi files of compositions from well-known classical composers like Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, and Mozart. The dataset should be labeled with the name of the composer for each score. Please only do your prediction only for below composers, therefore you need to select the required composers from the given dataset above.

1-Bach
2-Beethoven
3-Chopin
4-Mozart

The proposed project will be implemented using the following steps:

Data Collection: Data is collected and provided to you.

# Data Pre-processing: Convert the musical scores into a format suitable for deep learning models. This involves converting the musical scores into MIDI files and applying data augmentation techniques.

# Feature Extraction: Extract features from the MIDI files, such as notes, chords, and tempo, using music analysis tools.

# Model Building: Develop a deep learning model using LSTM architectures to classify the musical scores according to the composer.

# Model Training: Train the deep learning model using the pre-processed and feature-extracted data.

# Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the deep learning model using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

# Model Optimization: Optimize the deep learning model by fine-tuning hyperparameters.
